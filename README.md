# OVERVIEW
 > This repo is going to contain all of the demo code, code-a-longs, and other course material related to my C++ course(s).
 >
 > All of this is run using the mingw64 g++ compiler, and gdb for debugging, and using C++17 as the standard, all warnings will be displayed.
 >
 > As the class continues this README will be updated with future commits, and brief run downs of anything I coded myself.
 >Also when looking through the files the comments titled "My Notes" are just that MY notes. They will serve the purpose of letting me type out what i am learning in my own language,
 >and assist in cementing the knowledge.
>
> The name of the current course is; "Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond" and can be found on Udemy, it is taught by Dr. Frank Mitropoulos.
>
> A final note, the instructor used the Codelite IDE, and I used VSCode. So to save on repo space I did not include the codelite specific files in my commits. They come with the source code I will need to download, and was reccomended that I keep them just in case I do use that IDE at some point.


 ## Set Up Folder:

 > This folder contains the series of dummy "programs" that were both copied, and typed myself to test my IDE to make sure I had configured it properly for running C++.
 > They are all "Hello World" type programs.

 ## First Lessons:

 > The only programs I typed myself are in the FirstProgram, and Challenge folders, First Program was a simple code-a-long, it will ask you what your favorite number is between 1 and 100 take your input and save it to a variable, and then print a response.
 > While the challenge was to take the first program, and add functionality for it to
 > Claim that the input number was it's favorite number.

 ## Second Lessons:

 > I decided not to download the source code for this section, instead opting to type out my notes, and then code out what was being demonstrated on screen myself. While all of this is still the instructors code, strictly speaking I at least got the practice of typing this stuff out myself, and it helped. I was able to complete the section challenge while it was being explained. So I guess I will be doing this more in the future even though it greatly increased the lesson time due to pausing and rewinding.

 ## Third Lessons:

 > I decided not to download the source code for this section, instead opting to type out my notes, and then code out what was being demonstrated on screen myself. While all of this is still the instructors code, strictly speaking I at least got the practice of typing this stuff out myself, and it helped. The lessons and challenge for this entry had to do with Arrays and Vectors, and covered the basic rules, and syntax as well as going over some basic information about multidimensional functionality. The Challenge is just a series of tasks designed to get used to working with them, and how to access the information.

 ## Fourth Lessons:

 > I bet you are thinking it's going to be another cut and paste BLAH thing right? Not quite, these need to be at least somewhat informative so, This was a larger information packed group of lessons, where operators and expressions were covered. Again no downloaded source code is present, I have to memorize some of this somehow after all. The lessons contain simple examples of how each operator can be used, and in the case of Incrementation and Decrementation only Incrementing is used, but the rules present apply to both. In mIxed Expressions This teaches about static_cast(type), but with <> these instead, which is how we manually tell the compiler to check if the associated value can be converted into the specified type, and then to do the conversion. the rest covers relational operators for comparison, and logical operators for flow control and comparisons.

 >The challenge was to take in an integer and save it as US cents, and write a program that would then print out the number of Dollars, Quarters, Dimes, nickles, and pennies contained in the integer given.
 >the challenge contains a program with out using the Modulo operator AND one using Modulo.
