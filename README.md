# OVERVIEW
 > This repo is going to contain all of the demo code, code-a-longs, and other course material related to my C++ course(s).
 >
 > All of this is run using the mingw64 g++ compiler, and gdb for debugging, and using C++17 as the standard, all warnings will be displayed.
 >
 > As the class continues this README will be updated with future commits, and brief run downs of anything I coded myself.
 >Also when looking through the files the comments titled "My Notes" are just that MY notes. They will serve the purpose of letting me type out what i am learning in my own language,
 >and assist in cementing the knowledge.
>
> The name of the current course is; "Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond" and can be found on Udemy, it is taught by Dr. Frank Mitropoulos.
>
> A final note, the instructor used the Codelite IDE, and I used VSCode. So to save on repo space I did not include the codelite specific files in my commits. They come with the source code I will need to download, and was reccomended that I keep them just in case I do use that IDE at some point.


 ## Set Up Folder:

 > This folder contains the series of dummy "programs" that were both copied, and typed myself to test my IDE to make sure I had configured it properly for running C++.
 > They are all "Hello World" type programs.

 ## First Lessons:

 > The only programs I typed myself are in the FirstProgram, and Challenge folders, First Program was a simple code-a-long, it will ask you what your favorite number is between 1 and 100 take your input and save it to a variable, and then print a response.
 > While the challenge was to take the first program, and add functionality for it to
 > Claim that the input number was it's favorite number.

 ## Second Lessons:

 > I decided not to download the source code for this section, instead opting to type out my notes, and then code out what was being demonstrated on screen myself. While all of this is still the instructors code, strictly speaking I at least got the practice of typing this stuff out myself, and it helped. I was able to complete the section challenge while it was being explained. So I guess I will be doing this more in the future even though it greatly increased the lesson time due to pausing and rewinding.
