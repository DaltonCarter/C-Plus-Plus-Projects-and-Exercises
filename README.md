# OVERVIEW
 > This repo is going to contain all of the demo code, code-a-longs, and other course material related to my C++ course(s).
 >
 > All of this is run using the mingw64 g++ compiler, and gdb for debugging, and using C++17 as the standard, all warnings will be displayed.
 >
 > As the class continues this README will be updated with future commits, and brief run downs of anything I coded myself.
 >Also when looking through the files the comments titled "My Notes" are just that MY notes. They will serve the purpose of letting me type out what i am learning in my own language,
 >and assist in cementing the knowledge.
>
> The name of the current course is; "Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond" and can be found on Udemy, it is taught by Dr. Frank Mitropoulos.
>
> A final note, the instructor used the Codelite IDE, and I used VSCode. So to save on repo space I did not include the codelite specific files in my commits. They come with the source code I will need to download, and was reccomended that I keep them just in case I do use that IDE at some point.


 ## Set Up Folder:

 > This folder contains the series of dummy "programs" that were both copied, and typed myself to test my IDE to make sure I had configured it properly for running C++.
 > They are all "Hello World" type programs.

 ## First Lessons:

 > The only programs I typed myself are in the FirstProgram, and Challenge folders, First Program was a simple code-a-long, it will ask you what your favorite number is between 1 and 100 take your input and save it to a variable, and then print a response.
 > While the challenge was to take the first program, and add functionality for it to
 > Claim that the input number was it's favorite number.
